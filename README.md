# msc_research
A collection of code pertaining to the research performed as part of my MSc. degree

there are three main folders:
  -intial_clp
  -minimal_clp
  -minimal_nonredundant_clp

Each folder contains the ECLiPSe CLP code for the S. pombe yeast genome based on the corresponding knowledge representation

***** Please note: since publishing my thesis, bugs have been found in this code. For updated (correct) code, please see the COCOHoli-C repository *****
